## How to Run the Project

Create a new virtual environment using python venv 

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```
_If `python3` is not available, you can use `python` or `py`_


Activate the virtual environment

```
. .venv/bin/activate
```
Alternatively, you can use 
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open the notebook using either Jupyter Notebook, Jupyter Lab, or Google Colab.
Be sure to run all the cells.

## CS File 

For now, the .cs (or c# file) is there just for lookup purposes. It is not being used in the project, but it has to be implemented in Unity (eventually).
